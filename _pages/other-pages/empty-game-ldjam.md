Everything must go. A relaxing puzzle game to unwind with.  
Clear the room of all the objects by rotating it. If an object is not visible, it’s not there anymore.  

The game initially was made under 72 hour for Ludum Dare 37 contest.  

**Update: ‘Empty.’ is a winner of Ludum Dare 37 Jam! It shares the first place with two other titles. Woo-hoo! It is also #4 in the innovation category!** Full scores: [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=33150).
