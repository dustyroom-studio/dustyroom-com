A game where the pie charts can be fun.

We are glad to announce that we are releasing **full source of Aeroteque on GitHub**!  

The game grew quite a bit since Ludum Dare, evolving into both VR and Google Tango experience. In the Unity project, the original desktop gameplay is preserved and can be found in the GameplayDesktop scene, while the Google Tango motion tracking powered and optionally Cardboard VR gameplay can be found in GameplayTango scene.  

The game is much more fun in VR, especially if your movement in the real world is translated into the game thanks to [Project Tango’s](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/) motion tracking capabilities. But even if you don’t have Tango and Cardboard VR, the game is still worth checking out!
