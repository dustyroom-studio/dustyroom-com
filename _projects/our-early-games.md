A museum of our early projects.  

These games were made in the beginning of our studio's existence between years 2010—2014. Most of the games were casual games but some of them had a prolonged play-through. None of these projects are available now but there may be some memories left.

### Stunt Rush

### Polar Slide

Our second game. Initially made for a flash player but later ported to BlackBerry devices. It was a sokoban puzzle game where you move the ice cubes. The addictiveness of this game surpassed all the expectations. If you haven't yet, just find a good sokoban, thank us later.
