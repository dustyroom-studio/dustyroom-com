These games were made in the beginning of our studio's existence between years 2010—2014. Most of the games were casual games but some of them had a prolonged play-through. None of these projects are available now but there may be some memories left.

### Polar Slide

Our second game. Initially made for a flash player but later ported to BlackBerry devices. It was a sokoban puzzle game where you move the ice cubes. The addictiveness of this game surpassed all the expectations. If you haven't yet, just find a good sokoban, thank us later.
