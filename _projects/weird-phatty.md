Weird Phatty is a collection of highly unpredictable and totally unusable audio phrases recorded straight from the great little analog synth. The samples are mostly atonal, ranging from very quiet hiss and crackle to resonant sweeps and pseudo-sequenced riffs. The sound was made with one finger pressed one key.

 No knobs were turned (perhaps, except of on a couple of examples), no buttons were pressed, no effects, sequencers etc were applied during recording – just the internal modulation of the instrument. The point of recording such samples was to explore the deepest possibilities and seek for margins of the little angry synth. Instead of gathering dust on a hard drive, we put it out.
