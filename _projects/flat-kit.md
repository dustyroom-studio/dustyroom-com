Flat Kit is a complete solution to achieve the stylish cel-shaded look: shaders, models, image effects, presets, examples.
The custom shading model is versatile enough to work great for classic cel/toon shading and for unique styles of experimental projects.

**Features:**

  * Polished Cel shading with lots of capabilities (see below)
  * Gradient fog: Multi-stop horizontal/vertical gradient Fog Image Effect
  * Water shader
  * Outline Image Effect and Outline shader
  * LightPlane shader for 3D highlights and god rays
  * Mobile support
  * Built-in and URP support – all object shaders and post-processing effects support both rendering pipelines.
  * Terrain shader that works with Unity or third party terrain
  * Vertex color support (built-in RP only), also works with Polybrush
  * Ability to control Unity built-in shadows
  * Indirect lighting support
  * Intuitive, simple and streamlined interface — use only what you need
  * Color the scene precisely — without guesswork
  * Full source code
  * Elaborated online manual
